# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds application code, with feature UI in `src/components/`, routes in `src/routes/`, and shared utilities in `src/lib/`.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by TanStack Router; avoid manual edits and regenerate via the router tooling when routes change.
- Static assets live in `public/`, with global styling in `src/styles.css` and `src/logo.svg` for the app mark.
- Infrastructure/config files include `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and `wrangler.jsonc` (Cloudflare deployment).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm dev`: start the Vite dev server on port 3000 for local development.
- `pnpm build`: compile the production bundle to `dist/`.
- `pnpm preview`: serve the production build locally for smoke checks.
- `pnpm test`: run the Vitest test suite once.
- `pnpm run deploy`: build and deploy via Wrangler (requires Cloudflare credentials).
 - Use `pnpm` for package management and scripts.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React with module syntax; prefer `.tsx` for components and `.ts` for utilities.
- Follow existing file-based routing conventions: route files live under `src/routes/` and map to URLs.
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling; keep reusable UI in `src/components/`.
- When adding generated files (router tree), keep them out of manual edits and focus on source routes.

## Testing Guidelines
- Test runner: Vitest with Testing Library.
- There are no committed tests yet; when adding tests, place them near sources (e.g., `src/components/Button.test.tsx`).
- Run `pnpm test` before opening a PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- No commit history exists yet, so no established message convention. Use clear, imperative summaries (e.g., “Add event form validation”).
- PRs should include a concise description, testing notes (commands run), and screenshots for UI changes.

## Configuration & Deployment Notes
- Cloudflare deployment is configured in `wrangler.jsonc`; keep environment-specific values there or in Wrangler secrets.
- If adding new environment variables, document them in the PR description and ensure local dev parity.
